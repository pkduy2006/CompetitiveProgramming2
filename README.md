# CompetitiveProgramming2

## This repository was created to store all the assignments I completed while learning about the C++ programming language and competitive programming during my high school time but at the extra classes instead of at my high school. It is also used to review the knowledge I have about Data Structures and Algorithms while I am learning at university.
